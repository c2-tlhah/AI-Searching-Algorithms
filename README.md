Search Algorithms and Heuristic Functions for Problem Solving

This project explores various search algorithms and heuristic functions for solving different types of problems. It includes implementations of both uninformed and informed search algorithms applied to different environments, such as an "agent" environment and the classic Eight Puzzle problem. Additionally, it provides analysis of each algorithm's performance and comparison of different heuristic functions.

Introduction

The project aims to study and implement various search algorithms commonly used in artificial intelligence for problem-solving tasks. It covers both uninformed search algorithms, which do not use domain-specific knowledge, and informed search algorithms, which use heuristic functions to guide the search.
Implementation
Uninformed Search Algorithms

    Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    Depth-First Search (DFS)
    Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
    Greedy Best-First Search
    A* Search

Informed Search Algorithms for Eight Puzzle

    Greedy Best-First Search with Manhattan distance heuristic
    A* Search with Manhattan distance and number of misplaced tiles heuristics

Analysis

We analyze each algorithm's performance in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and path length. The analysis provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm in solving the given problems.
Comparison

We compare different heuristic functions used in the informed search algorithms for the Eight Puzzle problem. The comparison includes discussion on admissibility, efficiency, and suitability for the problem domain.
Usage
